# FlashGPT

FlashGPT utilizes the power of OpenAI's GPT language model to generate Solidity smart contracts and deploy them to Layer 1 and 2 solutions such as AltLayer flashlayer,Arbitrum, Ethereum, Gnosis, Polygon, Polygon zkEVM testnet, Optimism and Scroll alpha testnet.q

This is be a game-changer in the world of blockchain development. With this dApp, developers could leverage the natural language processing capabilities of GPT to create efficient, secure, and reliable smart contracts that can be easily deployed to L1/L2 solutions, making the entire process seamless and straightforward. The use of GPT would also help reduce the time and effort needed for smart contract development, which could result in faster project completion and reduced costs. Overall, this dApp would enable developers to create and deploy smart contracts with ease, paving the way for the next generation of blockchain applications.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
vm
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
